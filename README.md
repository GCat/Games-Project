# Games-Project
Year 3 games project.
<h1>Deus Deorum</h1>
<h2>Team Iceberg Ahead!</h2>

<h3>Developer Guide</h3>
Please put the work you are doing/ want to do on<a href="https://trello.com/niceberg"> Trello! </a>. We need to keep track of the work that needs to be done for the next deadline.<br/>
Please work on your own Unity scenes as we cannot merge them. Any improvements you make, please try and keep the modular (e.g Make a prefab) so we can put them together in the final build.<br/>

<h3>Setting up the game</h3>
Make sure you install the oculus & Kinect v2 drivers.
For ideal play conditions, clean the lens of the Kinect with a microfibre cloth, make sure the room is well lit, but avoid direct bright lights visible by the kinect sensor. Position the kinect ~1.5m off the ground.
